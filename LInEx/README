REQUIREMENTS
------------

LInEx has been tested on Linux and embedded Linux systems.

For compilation, GNU C compiler and standard libraries are required,
as well as the following Ubuntu/Debian packages (or equivalent packages
of other Linux distributions):
 - cmake 
 - crosscompiler for building embedded Linux executable (e.g. OpenWrt SDK)

The following packages are optional:
 - cmake-curses-gui (ccmake, interactive user interface of cmake)


-------------------------
BUILDING LINUX EXECUTABLE
-------------------------

This project uses cmake for setting platform- and user-specific compile 
options. In order to generate the Makefile for actual compilation, you 
need to call in the root of the source directory:

$ cmake .

In order to change the default compile options, use:

$ cmake -D OPTION1=value1 -D OPTION2=value2 ...

To get a list of the most important options, call:

$ cmake -LH
   
As a user-friendly alternative, you can use the interactive user interface.
Please note that this requires the package cmake-curses-gui, if you are using
Ubuntu/Debian.

$ ccmake .

If some libraries are installed in custom directories, use:

$ cmake -D CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/custom/directory1:/custom/directory2

After successfully generating the Makefile with cmake, start the 
compilation with:

$ make


---------------------------------
CROSSCOMPILING FOR EMBEDDED LINUX
---------------------------------

For crosscompiling, the default gcc compiler needs to be replaced by the
corresponding crosscompiler. This can be achieved with cmake options:

$ cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/alt/gcc

If you have previously called cmake with other settings, you need to manually 
remove the file CMakeCache.txt before calling cmake with the new compiler 
options.

After calling make, an executable for the embedded Linux platform is built.
In order to change between default compilers and crosscompilers, you may adapt
and use the shell scripts compileX86.sh and compileMIPS.sh.

In the following, we give some more detailed instructions for OpenWrt (see
http://openwrt.org). Different OpenWrt releases exist. In order to run the 
program on an OpenWrt router, you need to crosscompile with the OpenWrt SDK of 
the same release.

You can download the sources of an OpenWrt release from the OpenWrt subversion
repository. For OpenWrt 8.09 (kamikaze), this can be done as done as follows:

$ svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branches/8.09 openwrt

Since OpenWrt is not built by default, you need to call make menuconfig and
enable the SDK bullet. You must also change the target system and profile if 
your router does not match the default settings.

$ cd openwrt
$ make menuconfig
$ make

The crosscompilers can be found in staging_dir/toolchain-X/bin (where X depends
on the target system). In the case of OpenWrt 8.09, the gcc and g++ 
replacements for Linksys routers are mipsel-linux-uclibc-gcc and 
mipsel-linux-uclibc-g++.


-----------------------
USAGE AND CONFIGURATION
-----------------------

In order to run LInEx, a configuration file is needed which specifies the 
modules to be used and their parameters. 

$ ./LInEx -f <config_file>

You can get less or more output to stdout by using the -v X option, with X 
being a number between 0 and 5. Use Ctrl-C to stop LInEx.

The format of the configuration file is line based. Leading tabs and 
whitespaces are ignored. Lines starting with "#" are considered as comments 
and thus ignored by the configuration file parser.

The configuration is structured using seven different keywords written in 
upper-case letters: COLLECTOR, INTERVAL, ODID, XMLFILE, XMLPOSTPROCESSING, 
RECORD, MULTIRECORD, XMLELEMENT, FILE, and COMMAND. These keywords always 
appear at the beginning of a line.

COLLECTOR is followed by the IP address and port number of an IPFIX collector
to which the data is exported. It is possible to configure multiple collectors.
Example:

COLLECTOR 127.0.0.1:4739
COLLECTOR 192.168.1.99:4739

INTERVAL is followed by an integer value indicating the interval in seconds
which is used to periodically export the data. Default value is 30. Example:

INTERVAL 10

ODID is followed by the IPFIX Observation Domain ID used in the IPFIX 
Messages. Default value is 1. Example:

ODID 100

RECORD defines a record containing field values from different sources. 
MULTIRECORD defines a sequence of records containing multiple values of the 
same type extracted from a single source. A source is either a text file or 
the output of a shell command, specified with FILE or COMMAND, respectively.
A regular expression is applied to extract capturing groups from the source,
which then are converted into record field value.

FILE is followed by the path to the file, the number of capturing groups in the 
regular expressions, and the regular expression applied to the file. For each
capturing group, an additional line is read from the config file which defines
the field length, the transformation to binary format, the IPFIX Information
Element ID and enterprise number of the field. Here is an example with five
capturing groups read from the proc file /proc/loadavg:

FILE "/proc/loadavg", 5, "([0-9]+\.[0-9]+)[ \t]+([0-9]+\.[0-9]+)[ \t]+([0-9]+\.[0-9]+)[ \t]+([0-9]+)\/([0-9]+)"
  #load percentage in the last one minute
  4, 5, 1001, 10
  #load percentage in the last five minute
  4, 5, 1002, 220
  #load percentage in the last ten minute
  4, 5, 1003, 0
  #number of running processes
  4, 1, 1004, 0
  #total number of processes
  4, 1, 1005, 0

Each capturing group is transformed into a field of 4 bytes. The transformation
rule is specified with an identifier from 0 to 7:

  id  transformation                       possible field lengths
  0   no transformation                    any
  1   ascii to integer                     2 or 4
  2   ascii to unsigned integer            2 or 4
  3   ascii to IPv4 address                4
  4   ascii to MAC address                 6
  5   ascii to float/double                4 or 8
  6   ascii to percent (int of *100)       2
  7   NULL-terminated string               >=2

COMMAND has the same syntax as FILE, yet the first argument does not point to
a text file but contains a shell command. Example:

COMMAND "free", 6 , "Mem\:[ \t]+([0-9]+)[ \t]+([0-9]+)[ \t]+([0-9]+)[ \t]+([0-9]+)[ \t]+([0-9]+)"
  #total
  4, 1, 0, 0
  #used
  4, 1, 0, 0
  #free
  4, 1, 0, 0
  #shared
  4, 1, 0, 0
  #buffers
  4, 1, 0, 0
  #cached
  4, 1, 0, 0

The keywords FILE and COMMAND always appear after RECORD or MULTIRECORD. As 
RECORD supports multpile sources, multiple occurrences of FILE and COMMAND 
may appear after RECORD. If one of these sources is not available, the 
corresponding record fields are filled with zero values. 

The appearance of a new RECORD or MULTIRECORD keyword starts a new record.

XMLFILE is followed by a name of a local file in which status information can
be stored locally in XML format. Example:

XMLFILE "log.xml"

XMLPOSTPROCESSING is followed by a command which is executed after updating
the XML file. Example:

XMLPOSTPROCESSING "cat log.xml"

The XML file is periodically updated with the same interval as for the IPFIX
export. The content of the XML file is defined by XMLRECORD keywords. Each
occurrence of XMLRECORD is followed by the name of the root XML element. The 
following lines define sources starting with FILE or COMMAND, just like for 
RECORD and MULTIRECORD. 

In the case of XML, the capturing groups are not transformed into any binary
format but directly used as content of XML elements which appear below the
root XML element. The names of the XML elements appear in separate lines.
Example:

XMLRECORD ifconfig
  COMMAND "ifconfig", 2, "(\w+)[ \t]+Link[ \t]+encap:\w+[ \t]+HWaddr[ \t]+([a-eA-E0-9:]+)"
    #interface name
    if-name
    #mac address 
    mac-address

This yields the following XML output:

<ifconfig>
<if-name>xxx</if-name>
<mac-address>yyy</mac-address>
...
</ifconfig>

Multiple sources may follow the XMLRECORD keyword.

to get a complete example.
