# Instructions for building an OpenWRT package

1. Obtain and extract the OpenWRT SDK
2. Copy the LInEx folder into the package subfolder of the SDK.
3. Copy your LInEx root directory (i.e. the directory in which the root CMakeLists.txt file resides) to <OpenWRT SDK>/package/LInEx/src and remove the openwrt subfolder (the SDK searches for 
Makefiles recursively reincluding the package build Makefile)
4. Add the external build dependencies to the package folder of the SDK (e.g. assuming you are in the root directory of the SDK):
  svn export svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/packages/utils/bzip2 package/bzip2
  svn export svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/packages/libs/sctp package/sctp
  svn export svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branches/backfire/package/zlib package/zlib
4.a) If you are building this package for a 2.4 based kernel you will have to change the lksctp-tools version to 1.0.7 version (don't forget to remove the MD5SUM) as the header of newer versions 
is incompatible (changes in struct sctp_event_subscribe).
5. Build by running make
6. The package files can then be found in the bin/<architecture>/packages subdirectory
